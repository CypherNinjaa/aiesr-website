# 🚀 **FINAL STEP: SUPABASE STORAGE BUCKETS SETUP**

## 📋 **Current Status**

✅ **Code Implementation**: Storage service and enhanced EventForm completed  
✅ **Development Server**: Running at http://localhost:3000  
✅ **Admin Panel**: Accessible and functional  
⏳ **Storage Buckets**: Need to be created in Supabase

---

## 🎯 **STEP 1: Create Storage Buckets**

### **Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**

   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Login and navigate to your AIESR project
   - Click on **"Storage"** in the left sidebar

2. **Create Event Images Bucket**

   - Click **"Create bucket"**
   - **Bucket Name**: `event-images`
   - **Public**: ✅ Check this box (important!)
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

3. **Create Additional Bucket (Optional)**
   - Click **"Create bucket"** again
   - **Bucket Name**: `faculty-images`
   - **Public**: ✅ Check this box
   - Click **"Create bucket"**

### **Option B: Using SQL (Alternative)**

1. **Open SQL Editor** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Execute this SQL**:

   ```sql
   -- Create storage bucket for event images
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
   VALUES ('event-images', 'event-images', true);

   -- Create storage bucket for faculty images (optional)
   INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
   VALUES ('faculty-images', 'faculty-images', true);
   ```

---

## 🎯 **STEP 2: Configure Storage Policies**

1. **Stay in SQL Editor** (or open it if using Dashboard method)
2. **Execute Storage Policies**:

   ```sql
   -- Public read access for event images
   CREATE POLICY "Public Access for Event Images" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'event-images');

   -- Authenticated users can upload
   CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload event images" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
     bucket_id = 'event-images'
     AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
   );

   -- Admins can update/delete
   CREATE POLICY "Admins can update event images" ON storage.objects
   FOR UPDATE USING (
     bucket_id = 'event-images'
     AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM admin_users WHERE id = auth.uid())
   );

   CREATE POLICY "Admins can delete event images" ON storage.objects
   FOR DELETE USING (
     bucket_id = 'event-images'
     AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM admin_users WHERE id = auth.uid())
   );
   ```

## 🎯 **STEP 3: Test the Enhanced Image Upload**

### **Test File Upload Method**

1. **Navigate** to http://localhost:3000/admin/events/new
2. **Login** as admin if prompted
3. **Scroll** to "Event Image" section
4. **Click** "Upload Image" tab
5. **Select** an image file from your computer
6. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Upload progress spinner appears
   - ✅ Image preview shows after upload
   - ✅ No errors in browser console
   - ✅ Image URL starts with your Supabase project URL

### **Test URL Input Method**

1. **Click** "Image URL" tab
2. **Paste** a test image URL: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523240795612-9a054b0db644?w=800`
3. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Image preview appears immediately
   - ✅ No validation errors
   - ✅ URL is properly validated

### **Test Form Submission**

1. **Fill** required fields (title, description, etc.)
2. **Submit** the form
3. **Navigate** to main events page or homepage
4. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Event appears with correct image
   - ✅ Image loads fast (not base64)
   - ✅ Image URL is from Supabase storage

---

## 🎯 **STEP 4: Verify Storage in Dashboard**

1. **Go to Storage** section in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Click** on `event-images` bucket
3. **Check** that uploaded images appear in the bucket
4. **Note** the folder structure: `events/timestamp-filename.ext`
