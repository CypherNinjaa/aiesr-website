## 🌟 **KEY TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS**

### **Database Architecture**

```sql
-- Events table with full feature support
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  short_description TEXT NOT NULL,
  date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  end_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  location TEXT NOT NULL,
  type event_type NOT NULL,
  image TEXT,
  registration_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  registration_deadline TIMESTAMPTZ,
  featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  capacity INTEGER,
  speakers TEXT[],
  schedule JSONB,
  tags TEXT[],
  status event_status DEFAULT 'draft',
  created_by UUID REFERENCES admin_users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Image Handling System**

```typescript
// Dual input method with real-time preview
const [imageUploadMode, setImageUploadMode] = useState<"url" | "upload">("url");
const [imagePreview, setImagePreview] = useState<string>("");

// URL method - instant preview
const handleImageUrlChange = (url: string) => {
  handleInputChange("image", url);
  setImagePreview(url);
};

// File upload method - base64 conversion
const handleImageUpload = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const file = event.target.files?.[0];
  if (file) {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = e => {
      const result = e.target?.result as string;
      setImagePreview(result);
      handleInputChange("image", result);
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  }
};
```

### **Real-time Integration**

```typescript
// Real-time event subscriptions
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel("events-changes")
    .on("postgres_changes", { event: "*", schema: "public", table: "events" }, payload => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["events"] });
    })
    .subscribe();

  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
}, [queryClient]);
```
