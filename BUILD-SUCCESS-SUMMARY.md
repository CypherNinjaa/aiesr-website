### ⚠️ Non-Critical Warnings (Safe to Deploy)

1. **MetadataBase Warning:** Social media images default to localhost (production deployment will resolve this)
2. **Static Export Headers:** Headers configuration not applied in static export mode (expected behavior)
3. **React Hooks Dependencies:** Minor optimization opportunity in `useCommon.ts`
4. **TypeScript Any Types:** Performance monitoring utility uses `any` types (acceptable for monitoring code)
